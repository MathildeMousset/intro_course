Write the R code required to add two plus two:

<details><summary>Click here for explanation</summary

```{r, eval=F}
pacman::p_load(rio, here, tidyverse)

library(rio)
library(tidyverse)
  library(exceptionelle)
```

</details>


<script>
   $(document).ready(function() {
     $head = $('#header');
     $head.prepend('<img src=\"logo.png\" style=\"float: right;width: 150px;\"/>')
   });
</script>

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(learnr)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## Quiz

Some questions to verify that you understand the purposes of various base and recommended R packages:

```{r quiz}
quiz(
  question("Which package contains functions for installing other R packages?",
    answer("base"),
    answer("tools"),
    answer("utils", correct = TRUE),
    answer("codetools")
  ),
  question("Which of the R packages listed below are used to create plots?",
    answer("lattice", correct = TRUE),
    answer("tools"),
    answer("stats"),
    answer("grid", correct = TRUE)
  )
)
```
