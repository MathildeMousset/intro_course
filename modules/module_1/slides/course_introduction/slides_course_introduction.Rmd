EDGE - Explain, Demonstrate, Guide, Evaluate

***Fix image*** TODO

Lectures, Live coding demos, Guided exercises, evaluate
![](https://github.com/appliedepi/emory_training/blob/master/presentation/images/EDGE.png?raw=true)  



???
- The learning process can be summarised into this acronym "EDGE". Today's session is primarily a *demonstration* with question & answer session. We assume that you have read at least some of the relevant pages in the Epi R Handbook prior to this session. We also offer trainings in which we guide you through case studies with hands-on coaching.

# Course overview

**Audience:** Epidemiologists, public health practitioners, clinicians, applied researchers.  

**Objectives:** Participants learn how to use R, using standard datasets for applied epidemiology in the context of an outbreak investigation case study.

**Prerequisites:**
- Familiarity with epidemiological concepts.  
- Participants with no prior coding experience (e.g. SAS, Stata) are advised to take 1 extra day for the course.  
- Create account at [Applied Epi Community](www.community.appliedepi.org) (online Q&A support forum)

**Take-aways** 
- Comfort using R to import, clean, and perform basic analyses, transformations, and visualizations, and reporting on epidemiological data
- Ability to self-learn and expand your R knowledge  
- Certificate of participation

# Course format

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appliedepi/presentations/main/images/CourseTimeline.png)  
35.5 hours synchronous instruction

- *Comprehensive instruction:* 4 days (28 hours)

- *Sustained support:* 7.5 hours of follow-up sessions to help apply the skills to your work context (5 x 1.5-hour group “office hours” sessions)

Note: Applied Epi offers subscription "R Help Desk" services if you want continued on-call support in the months/years ahead.

# Learning objectives and schedule  

**Today we aim to help you:**  
* Understand R within the ecosystem of analytical tools  
* Navigate RStudio and R projects  
* Write a basic R script to load packages, import data, and view a dataset

# Data used in this course  

* Ebola case study  
     * Surveillance linelist  
     * Hospital linelists from 5 hospitals  
     * Aggregated case counts from one hospital  
     * Case investigation dataset  
     * Lab dataset  

* Near the end of the course, you will apply your skills to a COVID dataset

# Flexibility 

![](https://github.com/appliedepi/emory_training/blob/master/presentation/images/interoperability.png?raw=true)  


???
- R can read and write to loads of different software/databases.
- Can hold multiple datasets at once
- Can also produce many different outputs  
- Automated and reproducible workflows (saves you time and headache)

???
- R is free - and yet can do more than what expensive licensed software can  
- Previously limited to academic statisticians - R was not "trusted"  
- But now even pharma companies (e.g. GSK) and regulators are making the switch  
- It is the most widely used statistical programming language.
